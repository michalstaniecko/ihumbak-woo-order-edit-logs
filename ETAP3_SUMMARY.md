# Stage 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Stage 3 implementation has been completed successfully. This stage focused on implementing WooCommerce hooks for automatic change tracking across all order-related events.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Order Hooks (`includes/hooks/order-hooks.php`)

**Purpose:** Track order creation, updates, status changes, and field modifications.

**Key Functions:**
- `init_order_hooks()` - Initializes all order-related hooks
- `store_order_snapshot($order, $data_store)` - Stores order state before save
- `detect_order_changes($order, $data_store)` - Detects and logs changes after save
- `compare_and_log_field()` - Helper to compare and log single field changes
- `log_order_created($order_id, $order)` - Logs new order creation
- `log_status_change($order_id, $old_status, $new_status, $order)` - Logs status changes

**WooCommerce Hooks Used:**
- `woocommerce_before_order_object_save` - Store snapshot before save
- `woocommerce_after_order_object_save` - Detect changes after save
- `woocommerce_new_order` - Log order creation
- `woocommerce_order_status_changed` - Log status changes

**Tracked Changes:**
- Currency changes
- Payment method changes
- Total amount changes
- Tax changes
- Shipping cost changes
- Billing address changes (all fields)
- Shipping address changes (all fields)

### 2. Product Hooks (`includes/hooks/product-hooks.php`)

**Purpose:** Track product line item additions, updates, and deletions.

**Key Functions:**
- `init_product_hooks()` - Initializes product-related hooks
- `log_order_item_added($item_id, $item, $order_id)` - Logs new product additions
- `log_order_item_updated($item_id, $item, $order_id)` - Logs product updates
- `store_order_item_before_delete($item_id)` - Stores item data before deletion
- `log_order_item_deleted($item_id)` - Logs product deletion

**WooCommerce Hooks Used:**
- `woocommerce_new_order_item` - New product added
- `woocommerce_update_order_item` - Product updated
- `woocommerce_before_delete_order_item` - Before product deletion
- `woocommerce_delete_order_item` - Product deleted

**Tracked Changes:**
- Product additions with full details (ID, name, quantity, price)
- Quantity changes
- Price/total changes
- Product deletions

**Technical Notes:**
- Uses transients to store item data before deletion (60 second expiration)
- Only tracks `WC_Order_Item_Product` items
- Utilizes `$item->get_changes()` for HPOS compatibility

### 3. Address Hooks (`includes/hooks/address-hooks.php`)

**Purpose:** Provide granular tracking of email and phone changes.

**Key Functions:**
- `init_address_hooks()` - Initializes address-related hooks
- `track_email_phone_changes($order, $data_store)` - Tracks email/phone before save

**WooCommerce Hooks Used:**
- `woocommerce_before_order_object_save` - Track changes before save

**Tracked Changes:**
- Billing email changes
- Billing phone changes

**Technical Notes:**
- Works in conjunction with order-hooks.php for full address tracking
- Provides specific tracking for email/phone that might be missed by snapshot comparison

### 4. Payment Hooks (`includes/hooks/payment-hooks.php`)

**Purpose:** Track payment methods, shipping, coupons, fees, refunds, and order notes.

**Key Functions:**
- `init_payment_hooks()` - Initializes payment-related hooks
- `log_coupon_added($coupon_code)` - Logs coupon application
- `log_coupon_removed($coupon_code)` - Logs coupon removal
- `log_order_refunded($order_id, $refund_id)` - Logs refunds
- `log_note_added($note_id, $note_data)` - Logs new notes
- `log_note_deleted($note_id)` - Logs note deletions
- `log_fee_added/updated/deleted()` - Tracks fee changes
- `log_shipping_added/updated/deleted()` - Tracks shipping changes
- `get_current_order_id()` - Helper to extract order ID from context

**WooCommerce Hooks Used:**
- `woocommerce_applied_coupon` - Coupon added
- `woocommerce_removed_coupon` - Coupon removed
- `woocommerce_order_refunded` - Order refunded
- `woocommerce_new_order_note` - Note added
- `woocommerce_delete_order_note` - Note deleted
- `woocommerce_new_order_item` - Fee/shipping added
- `woocommerce_update_order_item` - Fee/shipping updated
- `woocommerce_before_delete_order_item` - Fee/shipping deletion (store data)
- `woocommerce_delete_order_item` - Fee/shipping deleted

**Tracked Changes:**
- Coupon additions and removals
- Refunds (amount, reason, refunded by)
- Order notes (content, customer/private distinction)
- Fee additions, updates, and deletions
- Shipping additions, updates, and deletions (method and cost)

**Technical Notes:**
- Uses transients for fee/shipping deletion tracking (60 second expiration)
- Handles `WC_Order_Item_Fee` and `WC_Order_Item_Shipping` item types
- Distinguishes between customer notes and private notes

### 5. Order_Logger Integration

**Updated:** `includes/class-order-logger.php`

**New Method:**
- `init_woocommerce_hooks()` - Loads and initializes all hook files

**Integration:**
- Hook initialization added to `init_hooks()` method
- Fires on `woocommerce_init` action for proper WooCommerce integration
- Checks file existence before loading
- Verifies function existence before calling

## Architecture Patterns

### Snapshot Pattern
- Uses WordPress transients for temporary storage
- Stores complete order state before modifications
- Compares snapshot with current state after save
- Automatically cleans up snapshots after logging
- 10-minute expiration for safety

### Transient Storage for Deletions
- Stores item data before deletion (60 second expiration)
- Allows logging of deleted item details
- Automatic cleanup prevents orphaned data

### Namespace Organization
- All hooks in `IHumBak\WooOrderEditLogs\Hooks` namespace
- Separate init function for each hook file
- Prevents function name collisions

## HPOS Compatibility

All hook implementations are HPOS-compatible:
- Uses `woocommerce_before/after_order_object_save` instead of CPT-specific hooks
- Leverages `HPOS_Compatibility::get_order_data_for_comparison()`
- Uses `$order->get_changes()` for change detection
- Works seamlessly in both CPT and HPOS storage modes

## Integration Points

### With Stage 1 Components:
- **Log_Database**: Used for all log insertions
- **HPOS_Compatibility**: Used for order data extraction

### With Stage 2 Components:
- **Order_Logger**: Main logging interface
- **Log_Tracker**: Snapshot storage and comparison
- **Log_Formatter**: Value formatting for storage
